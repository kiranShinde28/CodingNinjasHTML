           HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it's the "code" behind every Webpage- Even this one.If You'r just Beginning to learn HTML,let
           us tell you that it's fairly easy task.HTML without styling,can't do anything more than setting a Layout,drawing a table, or creating frame-
           but it is handy as it helps you to structure the content correctly,which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.  
         </p>

         <p>
           however simple this might seem,it is a mighty useful tool when it comes to full-fledge development.Various tools easily eliminates the HTML coding from
           your work process- but if you want to be in full contol of your web-page,you'll need to have some command over HTML.
         </p>
         <p>
           Through this article , we aim to give you the esential HTML bulding blocks that'll help you get up and running. 
           Reading this you'll be able to understand HTML source code and even modify it for your own good.
         </p>
         <p><h2> Step one -TAGS</h2></p>

           Tags are what you'll see most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally seen as wraper to any item on your HTML document
           Tags tell what magic to be done on the content enclosed by them.
         </p>
         <p>
           Let's look at two types of tags:
         </p>
         <ol>
           <p><li>1.&lt tag-example-1 &gt i need a closing tag &lt tag-example-1 &gt</li></p>
           <p><li>2.&lt tag-example-2 /&gt i don't need a closing tag </li></p>
          </ol>
          <p>In the first example, the sentence is wraped by two tags. The first one is called opening tag and second one is called closing tag.
            Everything in beetween affected by the properties of tags. very commonly used examples of such tags are &lt html &gt,
            &lt head &gt,  &lt body &gt,  &lt stong &gt, etc. 
          </p>
          <p>  
              The second example about tags is longer tags-as in, they don't need closing tag to function.Although it's not required 
              these types of tags written as &lt tag /&gt to make debugging of code easier. Common examples of such tags are
              &lt hr /&gt-used for horizontal line,&lt br /&gt- to break the line, etc.
          </p>  
          <p><h2> Step Two- HTML,HEAD,and BODY:The three pillars of your document </h2> </p>
          <img src='https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg' alt="head and body">
          <p>
            These tags are esential for any HTML document. they parcel out the esential part of your HTML code.
          </p>
          <ol>
              <li type="disc">&lt BODY &gt  &lt BODY /&gt is placed below your &lt HEAD &gt tag and everything you want to be
                displayed on your screen comes under this tag.Text ,images ,links, and prety much anything you can see in your browser
                live inside this tag
              </li>
              <li type="disc">&lt HTML &gt  &lt HTML /&gt wraps your entire code .Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside these tags.
                </li>
               <li type="disc">&lt HEAD &gt  &lt HEAD /&gt includes thinks like title,style, and scripts.
                  Head is usually present at the top(hah!),just inside the &lt HTML /&gt. 
                  </li>
               </ol>
               <p><h2> Step Three- A few tags that'll make your page pretty  </h2> </p>
               <p>
                 Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document ,let's processed with the things that will go inside 
                 your &lt BODY &gt tag and do some magic!
               </p>
               <p>
                 Some basic text formatting tags:
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li type="disc">&lt b &gt  &lt b /&gt makes your text look <b> bold</b>
                  </li>
                  <li type="disc">&lt i &gt  &lt i /&gt makes you write in <i> cursive </i>
                    </li>
                   <li type="disc">&lt u &gt  &lt u /&gt <u> underline </u> what you just wrote
                      </li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>
                     For example,these piece of code
                   </p>
                   <hr>
                   <p>
                     &lt html &gt
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       &nbsp &nbsp &lt head &gt  &lt/ head &gt <br>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &lt body &gt <br> 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt i &gt i am italics! &lt/ i &gt &lt br /&gt  <br> 
                      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt b &gt i am bold! &lt/ b &gt &lt br /&gt <br>
                      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt u &gt And me,well i am underlined! &lt/ u &gt &lt br /&gt 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &lt/ body &gt <br> 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      &lt/ html &gt
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Should produce something like this on your browser:Don't fret too much about the &lt br /&gt
                      .It's just for the breaking the line so that you can start from the next line .Enter key does little when it's come to
                      changing lines in your HTML document.
                     </p>

                     <p><h2> Tags to help you structure your content  </h2> </p>
                     <ol>
                        <li type="disc">&lt br /&gt breaks the line,making you continue to next line 
                        </li>
                        <li type="disc">&lt p &gt stands for paragraph.It devides your content into paragraphs 
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><i> Note: You need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very little
                          when it comes to formating content inside an HTML document
                         </i></p>
                         <p><h2>  Heading Tags:   </h2> </p>
                         <p>
                           HTML provides you with six tags from &lt H1 &gt &lt/ H1 &gt to &lt H6 &gt &lt/ H6 &gt
                           to help you create different sized header quickly.
                         </p>
                         <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png" alt="h1 to h6 ">
                         <p><h2>  Inserting an Image: </h2> </p>
                         <p>
                           All that's good, but what fun without images on the webpage?Don't worry,&lt IMG &gt to rescue!
                           The image tag has mandatoryattribute called "source" .Basically it tells the browser where it should look 
                           for the image.the syntax goes something like:<br><br>
                           <i>&lt img src="path_to_your_image"/&gt</i><br><br>
                           Furthermore,it's also have attributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width
                           you want your image to take.
                          </p>
                          <p><h2>  Lists:   </h2> </p>
                          <p>
                            HTML has two types of lists - orderd and unordered.Each item of your list ha sto be enclosed in tag.
                            The syntax for creating a list is fairly simple.<br> <br>
                            Suppose you want to create a list like:<br>
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li type="disc"> Item 1 </li> 
                            <li type="disc"> Item 2 </li>  
                            <li type="disc"> Item 3 </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                            The Following code will easily do the job for you:
                          </p>
                          <hr>    
                          <p>&lt ul &gt<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp &lt li &gt Item 1 &lt/ li &gt<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp &lt li &gt Item 2 &lt/ li &gt<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp &lt li &gt Item 3 &lt/ li &gt<br>
                            &lt/ ul &gt
                          </p> 
                          <hr><br><br>
                          <p>
                            This, by the way, was an example of unordered list.For an ordered list, all you need
                            to do is repalce &lt ul &gt With &lt ol &gt and &lt/ ul &gt with &lt/ ol &gt<br>
                            Let's see what the following code does:
                          </p>
                          <hr>
                          <div>
                          <p>
                              &lt html &gt
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                &nbsp &nbsp &lt head &gt  &lt/ head &gt <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 &nbsp &nbsp &lt body &gt <br> 
                            </p>
                           
                            <p>
                                &nbsp &nbsp &lt ul &gt<br>
